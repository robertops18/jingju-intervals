# Analysis of the heterophonic pitch relationship in jingju music

This notebook performs statistical analyses to extract insights that helps to gain a better understanding of the heterophonic pitch relationship between the vocal melody and the instrumental accompaniment in jingju music. 

Jingju singing is accompanied by an instrumental ensemble in heterophony. Here, the heterophonic pitch relationship is revealed by the distributions of the musical intervals formed between the vocal melody and the lead instrument in the ensemble (jinghu).
